    https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/
    for more information about the Google Sheets API. Depends on 'googleAuthR'
    Is based heavily on and draws great inspiration for Mark Edmondson's work
    with the 'googleAuthRverse'. Developed for greater parity with the 
    underlying sheets API and for R Shiny compatability.
